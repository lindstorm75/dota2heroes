# About

Dota 2 Heroes is a web project that mimics Dota 2 official heroes detail [site](https://www.dota2.com/heroes/) in term of filtering heroes, hovering on each of them and each hero's detail page. The hero cards is inspired by the . This project was developed primarily on **React.js** (with Vanilla JS), **CSS5** and **HTML**. I recently converted all the JS code to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

# Features

🐱‍🚀 You can filter heroes using their roles, attack types or names. Any hero that does not match the filter condition will be dimmed and you can no longer hover over them.
 
🐱‍💻 You can combine multiple filter conditions together for example **Carry** + **Ranged** + **Drow Ranger**

🐱‍👓 You can click on any hero to see more of their detail like their **roles** or **primary attribute**.
